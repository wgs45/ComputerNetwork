# 🌈✨ **Go-Back-N ARQ — The Pipelined Magic of Data Transmission!** 💌📡

---

## 🌟 **1. What Is Go-Back-N ARQ?**

_(Aka: The “trust-but-verify” protocol of the digital world~)_

🪄 **Go-Back-N ARQ (Automatic Repeat reQuest)** is a **protocol that allows the sender to transmit multiple frames before waiting for an acknowledgment (ACK)** — like sending several enchanted letters before checking if the first one arrived safely 💌

### 💫 **Core Ideas:**

🔹 **Protocol Pipelining:**
 The sender doesn’t wait after every frame—just keeps sending as long as the “magic window” allows!

🔹 **Sequential Numbering:**
 Each frame has a **sequence number** (like numbered charms on a bracelet ✨) to keep track of the order.

🔹 **Sender’s Window (N):**
 The window defines **how many frames** the sender can send without getting ACKs.
 If `N = 4`, it means the sender can have up to **4 unacknowledged frames** flying through the air~ 🚀

🔹 **Timeout Retransmission:**
 If an ACK doesn’t come back within a certain time ⏳, the sender **re-sends all frames** in that current window—
 like rewinding time to fix a miscast spell~ 🌀

🔹 **Finite Sequence Numbers:**
 Since there are only limited bits to label frames, the sequence numbers **wrap around** cyclically (0 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 0...) ♻️

## 🧭 **2. How It Works (Step-by-Step Journey~)**

Imagine Euphie 💖 sending magical letters (frames) to Master across the network~

1️⃣ **Euphie** starts sending letters 0, 1, 2, and 3—without waiting for replies yet ✉️✉️✉️✉️
2️⃣ **Master** receives them and sends ACKs back one by one 🪶
3️⃣ If letter “1” gets lost in a storm ☁️, Euphie doesn’t panic—she waits for a timeout ⏰
4️⃣ When the timeout hits, she **“goes back N”** and resends **all letters starting from the lost one** (1, 2, 3 again!) 💨

✔️ Efficient when the network is stable
⚠️ But can resend extra frames if even one goes missing!

## 🧮 **3. Example (Visualizing the Magic ✨)**

**Let’s say:**

- Window size = 4
- So sequence numbers = 0, 1, 2, 3

After 3 comes 0 again → the numbering cycles like a looping melody 🎶

```
Frames Sent:   0 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 0 → 1 → 2 → 3 → ...
ACK Expected:  0 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 0 → 1 → 2 → 3 → ...
```

🧠 **Key Insight:**
The **number of bits (i)** in the sequence number decides how many frames you can track.
For example:

- If `i = 2` bits → `2^2 = 4` sequence numbers → 0, 1, 2, 3

## 💎 **4. Quick Recap (TL;DR ✨)**

| 💡 Concept               | 💬 Summary                                               |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Purpose**              | Reliable data transfer using multiple outstanding frames |
| **Method**               | Send up to N frames before waiting for ACK               |
| **If Error Happens**     | Go back and resend from the last unacknowledged frame    |
| **Efficiency**           | High throughput if errors are rare                       |
| **Sequence Wrap-around** | Uses modulo arithmetic (e.g., 0 → 1 → 2 → 3 → 0)         |

## 🌸 **5. Fun Analogy: “The Letter Delivery Spell”** 💌

> Imagine you’re a mage sending letters to your friend with enchanted doves. 🕊️
> You can send four doves at once (window = 4).
> If one dove gets lost, you kindly resend _all_ from that point onward—because reliability > speed 💕
