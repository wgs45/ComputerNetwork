## 🔹 What is PPP? 📡

PPP (Point-to-Point Protocol) is a **Data Link Layer** protocol (Layer 2 in OSI) that helps **two computers** communicate directly, like pen pals using high-speed magic scrolls! ✨

### 💫 Key Traits

- 🔗 **Layer**: Data Link Layer (Layer 2)
- 🌍 **Use Case**: Designed for **WAN links** — especially over the **Internet**
- 🚄 **Speedy**: Great for **high-speed broadband** with heavy traffic
- 🧳 **Multiprotocol Support**: Can carry data from multiple protocols (like IP, IPX, etc.)
- 🤝 **Point-to-Point**: Works between just **two connected devices**

🧁 **TL;DR**:
PPP is your trusty digital mail owl 🦉 that flies between two networked computers, carrying any kind of letter (protocol) safely and swiftly\~!

## 📦 PPP Frame Format – Like a magical envelope! ✉️✨

```
| Flag | Address | Control | Protocol | Payload | Checksum | Flag |
| 8 b  |  8 b    |   8 b   |  16 b    |   -     |  16 b    | 8 b  |
```

Let’s unravel the scroll piece by piece\~ 🌸

| Field           | Size    | Meaning                                                                             |
| --------------- | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🎏 **Flag**     | 8 bits  | _Start/End marker_. Always `01111110` — like a sparkly ribbon tying the frame\~ 🎀  |
| 🏷️ **Address**  | 8 bits  | Set to `11111111` for broadcast (universal destination) 📨                          |
| 🎮 **Control**  | 8 bits  | Used for flow control (usually `00000011`) — like a spell stabilizer\~ ✨           |
| 🧪 **Protocol** | 16 bits | Identifies what kind of payload is inside (like "this letter contains IP data!") 🧾 |
| 📦 **Payload**  | Varied  | The actual message being sent 📨 (up to **1500 bytes**, or negotiated)              |
| 🧮 **Checksum** | 16 bits | Error detection spell! Detects if something went wrong mid-transmission\~ ❗        |
| 🎏 **Flag**     | 8 bits  | The frame ends with the same magical ribbon\~ 🎀                                    |

🌸 **Fun Analogy**:
Imagine sending a magical package 🪄📦 — the flag is the wrapping, the address is who it's for, the protocol is what’s inside, and the checksum is the inspection seal\~ 💌

## 🔸 Character Stuffing (a.k.a Byte Stuffing) 🧵✨

> When the payload _accidentally mimics_ the flag… oops! We need a way to avoid confusion\~ 🫣

🎭 **Problem**:
If the payload contains `01111110` (the flag pattern), the receiver might think the frame has ended early! 😨

🪄 **Solution**:
Insert an **extra escape byte** (`01111101`) before any flag-like byte in the payload. This is called **character stuffing** (or byte stuffing)!
Like saying, "Don't worry, that was just decoration\~ not the real flag!" 🎀✨

💡 **Visual**:

```
Original payload: 01111110 (Oops! That’s a flag!)
Stuffed payload:  01111101 01111110 (Yay! Now it's safe~)
```

🌟 **TL;DR**:
Character stuffing is like adding a cute warning label before a suspicious-looking gift in the package 🎁✨ so it’s not mistaken for the end!
