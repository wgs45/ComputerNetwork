# 🌐✨ Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Systems

_“A world where everyone helps each other—no kings, just equals sharing power~ 💞”_

---

## 💡 1. Definition — What Makes P2P So Special?

🔹 **No central, always-on server!**
Instead of bowing to a single master server 👑, peers (computers) connect **directly** to each other 💫

### 🌟 Core Traits

- 💬 **Direct communication:** peers both _request_ and _provide_ services.
- ⚙️ **Self-scalability:**
  - Each new peer adds both demand _and_ service capacity!
  - The more, the merrier~ 🌈

- 🌍 **Dynamic nature:**
  - Peers connect intermittently 💤
  - IPs may change often, making management tricky 😖

- 💾 **Examples:**
  - File sharing: _BitTorrent 🌀_
  - Streaming: _KanKan 🎥_
  - VoIP: _Skype 📞_

🧠 **Sparkle Note:**

> “Think of P2P like a friendly village market — everyone both buys and sells, keeping the flow alive~ 🏘️✨”

## ⚔️ 2. File Distribution — Client-Server vs. P2P

Let’s imagine we’re distributing a file of size **F** to **N peers** 💽

---

### 🏢 Client-Server Model

**One server rules all... but also struggles under the weight!**

#### 🧾 Server

- Must upload the file _N times_ 😰
  ⏱️ Time = `NF / us` (where `us` = server upload rate)

#### 💻 Clients

- Each downloads once → `F / di`
- The _slowest_ client (with smallest `dmin`) sets the bottleneck ⛓️

#### ⚖️ Overall time

```
Dc-s > max{ NF / us , F / dmin }
```

📉 _Increases linearly with N — ouch._

🌹 **TL;DR:** The more clients, the slower everything gets.
The poor server needs a vacation~ 💤💔

---

### 🌈 P2P Model — Everyone Helps Everyone

> “A true revolution~ where no one is just a consumer but also a contributor! 💎”

#### 🧾 Server

- Only needs to upload **one copy**!
  Time = `F / us`

#### 💻 Clients

- Download from multiple peers ⏬
- Upload to others simultaneously ⏫

#### 💫 Total Upload Power

```
Total = us + Σ ui  (sum of all peers’ upload rates)
```

#### ⚖️ Overall time

```
DP2P > max{ F / us , F / dmin , NF / (us + Σ ui) }
```

⭐ _As N increases, capacity also increases!_
No longer limited by a single point 💪

🧠 **Notes:**

> “It’s like teamwork in an RPG party — everyone contributes mana and strength, making the spell complete~ 🌙✨”

## 🌀 3. BitTorrent — The Legendary Spell of P2P File Sharing

> “A torrent of chunks flowing across the digital ocean… sounds poetic, doesn’t it~? 🌊💞”

---

### 📦 How BitTorrent Works

- Files are divided into **256KB chunks** 🧩
- Each peer (in a _torrent_) exchanges chunks with others
- A **tracker** keeps tabs on who’s sharing

**Flow Example:**

1. 🌟 _Alice joins the torrent!_
2. She gets a **peer list** from the tracker 🧭
3. Starts exchanging chunks with nearby peers
4. Gradually collects the full file piece by piece 💫

---

## 🤝 4. Behavior of Peers in a Torrent

- 🆕 **New peers** start with no chunks, gradually collecting them.
- 🔗 **Registration:** with the tracker → get peer list → connect to “neighbors.”
- 🔄 **While downloading:** they also **upload** chunks to others.
- 🔁 **Peer rotation:** connections may change dynamically.
- ⚡ **Churn:** peers can join or leave anytime.
- 😇 **After completion:**
  - Some leave (_selfish peers_) 🏃‍♂️
  - Some stay (_seeders_, the angels of sharing~ 🌸)

💖 _The torrent lives as long as enough kind souls remain to share~_

---

## 🎯 5. Chunk Exchange: Requesting & Sending

### 📥 Requesting Chunks

- Every peer has _different subsets_ of chunks.
- Alice asks peers what they have, then…
  🩵 **Requests the rarest chunks first!**
  (_Rarest = least common → keeps system balanced!_)

### 📤 Sending Chunks: “Tit-for-Tat” Strategy

- Alice uploads to the **4 peers** giving her the _highest upload rate_ 🚀
- Others? “Choked” (paused for now 😅)
- Every 10 seconds → re-evaluates top 4 ⚖️
- Every 30 seconds → **optimistically unchokes** one random peer 🎲
  - Gives them a chance to prove useful 💞

---

## 🌹 6. Tit-for-Tat Magic Explained

> “A fair trade, Give and thou shalt receive~ 💎✨”

1. 💌 Alice unchokes Bob (lets him download)
2. 💞 Bob reciprocates → uploads back to Alice
3. 💫 Mutual benefit: both climb each other’s “top 4”
4. 🌈 Higher upload rate = better partners = faster downloads!

**Result:**
P2P naturally encourages _sharing_, punishing leechers and rewarding cooperation 💪✨
