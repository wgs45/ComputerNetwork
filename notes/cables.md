# **Cables** 🔌

---

### **Wired Media** 🌐

- **Copper Cable** (Ethernet Cable)
  - **Unshielded Twisted Pair** (UTP)
  - **Shielded Twisted Pair** (STP)
- **Copper Coaxial Cable**
- **Fiber Optic Cable**

---

### **Crosstalk** 🔇

- **UTP cables** don’t use shielding to protect against **Electromagnetic Interference (EMI)** and **Radio Frequency Interference (RFI)**.
- **Crosstalk** effects can be reduced by varying the number of twists per wire pair.

---

### **Fiber Optic Media** 💡

- Uses **light waves** to transmit data.
- **High-speed transmission** with less signal degradation over long distances.

### **Copper vs Fiber Optic Media** ⚡

| **Implementation Points**          | **Copper**        | **Fiber Optic**      |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------- | -------------------- |
| **Bandwidth Supported**            | 10 Mbps - 10 Gbps | 10 Mbps - 100 Gbps   |
| **Range**                          | Up to 100 meters  | Up to 100,000 meters |
| **Immunity to EMI/RFI**            | Low               | Completely immune    |
| **Immunity to Electrical Hazards** | Low               | Completely immune    |
| **Media & Connector Cost**         | Lowest            | Highest              |
| **Installation Skills**            | Lowest            | Highest              |
| **Safety**                         | Lowest            | Highest              |

### **Wireless Media** 📡

Concerns:

- **Coverage area**
- **Interference**
- **Security**

**Examples of Wireless Technologies**:

- **Wi-Fi**
- **Bluetooth**
- **WiMax**

### **Physical Layer** 🏗️

The **Physical Layer** is responsible for transmitting **bits** over a medium.  
Services provided:

- Physical characteristics of the media
- Representation of bits
- Data rate
- Synchronization of bits
- Line configuration
- Physical topology
- Transmission mode

---

### **Line Configuration** 🔗

- **Point-to-Point Connection**:
  - A dedicated link between **two devices**.
  - The entire link capacity is reserved for these two devices.
- **Multipoint Connection**:
  - Also known as **multi-drop** or **broadcast** connection.
  - More than two devices share a **single link**, meaning the link’s capacity is shared.
