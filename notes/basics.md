## 🏗 **Key Characteristics of Computer Networks**

🔹 **Fault Tolerance** 🔧  
✔️ Keeps running even if parts fail.  
✔️ Ensures no loss of service.

🔹 **Scalability** 📈  
✔️ Can grow as needed.  
✔️ Maintains performance even after expansion.

🔹 **Quality of Service (QoS)** 🚀  
✔️ Prioritizes important data.  
✔️ Reduces delay, loss, and congestion.

🔹 **Security** 🔒  
✔️ Prevents unauthorized access, misuse, and forgery.  
✔️ Ensures **Confidentiality**, **Integrity**, and **Availability** (CIA).

## 🔄 **Network Protocols & Communication**

💡 **Protocols** = Rules for data communication.

📌 **Elements of Protocols:**  
✔️ Message **Encoding** 📝  
✔️ Message **Formatting & Encapsulation** 📦  
✔️ Message **Timing** ⏳  
✔️ Message **Size** 📏  
✔️ Message **Delivery Options** (Unicast, Multicast) 📡

## 🖥️ **Types of Networks**

🔹 **Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Network** 🔄  
✔️ No central administration.  
✔️ All devices are equal.  
✔️ Simple but **not scalable**.

🔹 **Client-Server Network** 🖥️🔗💻  
✔️ Centralized control.  
✔️ Follows a **request-response model**.  
✔️ Scalable, but the server can be overloaded.

## 🌍 **Network Classifications**

- **LAN (Local Area Network)** 🏠 – Small, like home or office (Wired LAN, Wi-Fi).
- **MAN (Metropolitan Area Network)** 🏙️ – Covers a city (Routers, Bridges).
- **WAN (Wide Area Network)** 🌎 – Large-scale (Internet, global networks).

## 🔄 **Network Topology (Layout)**

📌 **Two types:**  
🔹 **Physical Topology** – How devices are **placed**.  
🔹 **Logical Topology** – How **data flows**.

💡 **Common Topologies:**  
✔️ **Bus** 🚋 | ✔️ **Ring** 🔄 | ✔️ **Star** ⭐ | ✔️ **Mesh** 🕸️ | ✔️ **Hybrid** 🔗

---

## 🚋 **Bus Topology**

✔️ **Pros:**

- ✅ Cost-effective (uses a single cable).
- ✅ Simple setup, good for temporary networks.

❌ **Cons:**

- 🚫 No redundancy (if the cable fails, the network fails).
- 🚫 Limited length, no security.

---

## 🔄 **Ring Topology**

✔️ **Pros:**

- ✅ Faster than Bus topology.
- ✅ Equal access for all nodes.

❌ **Cons:**

- 🚫 Unidirectional – if one node fails, the network fails.
- 🚫 Heavy traffic can slow it down.

---

## ⭐ **Star Topology**

✔️ **Pros:**

- ✅ Easy to design & manage.
- ✅ Scalable with centralized control.

❌ **Cons:**

- 🚫 **Single point of failure** (hub/switch failure = entire network down).
- 🚫 Can be expensive due to networking hardware.

> [!NOTE]
> 📌 **Extended Star Topology** = A star with extra networking devices for expansion! 🌟

---

## 🕸️ **Mesh Topology**

✔️ **Pros:**

- ✅ Highly **fault-tolerant** (multiple connections).
- ✅ Reliable data transmission.

❌ **Cons:**

- 🚫 Expensive due to extra cabling.
- 🚫 **Broadcasting issues** in large networks.

---

## 🔗 **Hybrid Topology**

A **combination** of two or more basic topologies! 🎭

- ✔️ Flexible, scalable, and reliable.
- ✔️ Used in large-scale networks like enterprises.
