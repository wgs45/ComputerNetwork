# **Layering** üîÑ

---

### **What is Layering?**

- Layering is the process of breaking down a complex problem into smaller, more manageable **layers**.
- **Advantages**:
  - **Modular design** (Easier to work with and modify).
  - **Simpler troubleshooting** (Issues can be isolated to specific layers).

### **Layered Architecture**

- **OSI Reference Model**
- **TCP/IP Model**

## **The OSI Model** üåç

### **What is OSI?**

- **OSI** stands for **Open Systems Interconnection**.
- It‚Äôs a model used to understand and design **network architectures** that are **flexible, robust, and interoperable**.
- Developed by the **International Standards Organization (ISO)**.
- **Not a protocol**, but a **guideline** (referred to as the **OSI Reference Model**).

### **Purpose of OSI Model**

- **Goal**: To facilitate communication between different systems without changing the underlying **hardware** or **software** logic.
- The OSI model is never fully implemented; it‚Äôs used as a **framework** or **guideline**.

## **The TCP/IP Model** üåê

### **What is TCP/IP?**

- **TCP/IP** = **Transmission Control Protocol / Internet Protocol**.
- **Developed before the OSI model**, hence its layers **don‚Äôt perfectly match** with the OSI model.
- **Hierarchical protocol** with interactive modules, each providing specific functionality.

## **Fundamental Principles of the Physical Layer** ‚ö°

- One of the primary functions of the **Physical Layer** is to transmit data as **electromagnetic signals** across a transmission medium (such as cables).
- The data is often in a form **not usable for transmission** (for example, an image or text).
- To transmit data over a network, it must be converted into **electromagnetic signals** that can travel through the medium.
