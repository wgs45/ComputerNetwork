### 🔍 **What is an IP Address?**

An **IP Address** is a **unique identifier** for devices connected to a network. It's like a **home address** but for computers! 🏠💻

📌 **Types of IP Addresses:**

- 1️⃣ **IPv4** – Uses **32 bits** (4 octets), written in **decimal** (e.g., **192.168.1.1**).
- 2️⃣ **IPv6** – Uses **128 bits**, written in **hexadecimal** (e.g., **2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334**).

📌 **Key Facts:**

- ✔️ **Assigned Manually or Dynamically** (via DHCP).
- ✔️ **IPv4 Range:** **0.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255** 🌍
- ✔️ **IPv4 Format:** **x.x.x.x** (Each octet = 8 bits, total **32 bits**).
- ✔️ **IPv6 is the future!** (Larger address space and better security 🔐).
